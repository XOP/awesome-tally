Small app for specific tally needs.  
It helps to count up items/events/units in series ("tally trains")  
and tracks history from the very first one.

**NB:**  
This is a mere prototype application including several experiments with different technologies.  
It is also **mobile-oriented**, so desktop look and feel is a bit unconventional.
